## üìÑ Abstract

T81Coin is a post-binary cryptocurrency built upon the T81 computing framework‚Äîa ternary logic virtual machine designed to simulate symbolic reasoning, recursion, and entropic optimization. Unlike traditional blockchains which rely on binary-based hash competition (e.g., SHA-256), T81Coin introduces **symbolic proof-of-work** based on **entropy-aware recursive computation**. It leverages the **TISC instruction set**, **AxionAI** for self-optimizing block execution, and **ternary arithmetic** to power a chain that mirrors cognition rather than brute force.

## üîë Key Innovations

- **Base-81 Hashing**: Uses `SHA3-81`, a ternary entropy-driven hash function  
- **Recursive Proof-of-Work (rPoW)**: Miners solve symbolic puzzles with depth constraints and entropy evaluation  
- **Symbolic Transactions**: Graph-structured transactions with embedded AI metadata  
- **AxionAI Kernel**: On-chain AI that dynamically adjusts block difficulty, contract optimization, and system healing  
- **Entropy-Aware Consensus**: Block validity is ranked not just by hash, but by symbolic compression and system-wide entropy balance  
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Leverages ternary ECC, modular cryptographic TISC opcodes (`FERMAT`, `LUCAS`, `CRT`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

| Layer            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **T81Lang**      | Contract and application logic (compiled into TISC) |
| **TISC**         | Symbolic ternary opcodes for PoW, consensus, smart contract execution |
| **AxionAI**      | Self-optimizing runtime that profiles blocks, adjusts network load, ranks miner quality |
| **SHA3-81**      | Variable-output ternary hash function designed for symbolic entropy encoding |
| **Ledger Format**| Graph-encoded DAG ledger using `T81Graph` and `T81Tensor` for data modeling |
| **Smart Contracts**| Recursive symbolic flows, supporting AI evolution, dynamic pricing, contract rewrites |

## ‚õèÔ∏è Recursive Proof-of-Work (rPoW)

T81Coin replaces flat nonce-based guessing with symbolic work:

```t81
tensor_result = contract_tensor_contract(block_metadata, difficulty_tensor)
entropy_score = t81_entropy(tensor_result)
if entropy_score < ENTROPIC_THRESHOLD:
    broadcast_block()
```

Miners generate **recursive tensors** using contract metadata, scored using symbolic entropy evaluation.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Next Steps

We invite researchers, cryptographers, and distributed systems developers to help us:
- Implement SHA3-81 in ternary assembly and GPU
- Build rPoW consensus layers and entropy testnets
- Prototype T81Coin in symbolic emulation with VirtualBox/QEMU
- Join a post-binary ecosystem that embraces symbolic intelligence, not just brute force
