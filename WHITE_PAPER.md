## Abstract

T81Miner introduces a novel hybrid mining architecture that uses ternary computing as a symbolic entropy-aware preprocessor to optimize traditional Bitcoin SHA-256 mining. The miner combines a base-81 ternary logic engine with a binary mining backend to intelligently score and prioritize nonce candidates, reducing wasted computation while opening the door to post-quantum, AI-augmented consensus systems.

---

## Motivation

Current mining algorithms operate on brute-force exploration of the nonce space, leading to energy inefficiencies and repetitive collisions. T81Miner leverages symbolic entropy evaluation, recursive stack modeling, and ternary logic to introduce intelligence into the mining process, transforming it from brute force to informed search.

---

## System Components

### T81 Entropy Engine
- Uses `T81BigInt`, `T81Tensor`, and `SHA3-81` for entropy scoring
- Models nonce search as a recursive graph walk
- Provides high-probability nonces to the binary mining core

### SHA-256 Backend
- Standard double-SHA hash check against Bitcoin difficulty target
- Receives nonce candidates from T81 engine
- Benchmarked using standard testnet block headers

### AxionAI
- Symbolic AI kernel that adjusts entropy scoring heuristics in real-time
- Analyzes Hamming distances, entropy convergence, and recursive patterns
- Optional logging and optimization layer

---

## Hybrid PoW Strategy

Instead of discarding invalid hashes, T81Miner:
- Profiles entropy of each hash input/output
- Feeds entropy scores into AxionAI for adaptive optimization
- Uses symbolic thresholds to skip low-quality nonce spaces

---

## Applications

- Augmenting ASIC/GPU Bitcoin miners with entropy prediction
- Co-mining Bitcoin and T81Coin using shared preprocessing logic
- Testing post-binary consensus protocols on binary infrastructure
- Research platform for recursive PoW algorithms and entropy analytics

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Project scaffold and module separation
- [ ] Implement `t81_entropy_score()` and test against linear miner
- [ ] Integrate AxionAI profiling with SHA-256 hash loop
- [ ] Benchmark entropy-normalized hashes vs traditional
- [ ] Deploy on testnet pool with entropy-prioritized block submission

---

## Conclusion

T81Miner represents a new philosophy of computation in cryptocurrency mining: intelligent recursion, symbolic entropy, and ternary logic working together to make Bitcoin mining more efficient, adaptive, and forward-compatible. It is both a tool and a research platform for a smarter consensus future.
